# perl-pp-autolink

![macos](https://github.com/shawnlaffan/perl-pp-autolink/workflows/macos/badge.svg)

pp is a tool that packs perl scripts and their dependencies into a stand alone executable.  https://metacpan.org/pod/pp

However, it currently does not find external dynamic libs. These can be added to the pp call using the ```--link``` option,
but knowing which dynamic libs to list is a source of general angst.  This tool automates that process.

The pp_autolink.pl script finds dependent dynamic libs and passes them to a pp call.

It has been tested for Windows and Mac machines only so far.  It is untested on linux and unix variants, or other OS types.

The argument list is the same as for pp.  

```perl
perl pp_autolink.pl -o some.exe some_script.pl
```

It will also scan files passed as --link arguments

```perl
perl pp_autolink.pl -o some.exe --link /path/to/some.dylib some_script.pl
```


Note that currently only one script is supported, and it must be the last argument in the command.  

PRs are welcome.
